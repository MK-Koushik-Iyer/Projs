    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Greetings to all! welcome to my site. This site will give you an interface to look through different services that are catered in today's world in the technological sense.
    <p>Without any further adieu! Lets hop into. In this introduction I will be taking you through my site.</p>
    <img src="./Demo.png" alt="DEMO photo" class="book"><p class="pen"><strong>Welcome Aboard!</strong></p>
    <ul>    
        <li>Home is a navigation link where we are.</li>
        <li>About is a navigation link that gives you a gist about the services.</li>
        <li>Services is a navigation link that gives you a tabulated data about each service mentioned.</li>
        <li>Awards is a navigation link that would list some awards won by companies that created those services.</li>
        <li>Projects is a navigation link that would list few upcoming projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>A brief about the gestures and basic dynamics that I have added:</h4>
    <p>Firstly you may be able hover over the abovementioned links, whenever you hover I have made it to change its background appearance.
        Secondly I have also added the <br>tabbing ability into this site. Whenever try tabbing  then as well the background appearance of the navigation links changes.
        Lastly I have made the it possible to persist the <br>color change while you still on one of the navigation link. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Just for Fun! I have added transitions on the "Demo" image.
        If wanted try hovering over the image.</strong>
