    <p>
      Greetings to all! welcome to my site. This site will give you an interface
      to look through different services that are catered in today's world in
      the technological sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any further adieu! Lets hop into. In this introduction I will be
      taking you through my site.

    <p class="pen"><strong>Welcome Aboard!</strong></p>
    <ul>    
      <li>Home is a navigation link where we are.</li>
      <li>About is a navigation link that gives you a gist about the services.</li>
      <li>Services is a navigation link that gives you a tabulated data about each service mentioned.</li>
      <li>Projects is a navigation link that would list few upcoming projects.</li>
  </ul>
    <h4>A brief about the gestures and basic dynamics that I have added:</h4>
    <p>
      Firstly you may be able hover over the abovementioned links, whenever you
      hover I have made it to change its background appearance. Secondly I have
      also added the <br />tabbing ability into this site. Whenever try tabbing
      then as well the background appearance of the navigation links changes.
      Lastly I have made the it possible to persist the <br />color change while
      you still on one of the navigation link.
    </p>
